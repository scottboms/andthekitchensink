The (ALL NEW) kitchen sink script does one thing - it builds a fully functional and sufficiently exhaustive web development environment for Intel Mac computers without requiring a package manager or additional framework overhead.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
* Macintosh with an Intel processor
* Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard or newer)
* Xcode Developer Tools
* Environment variables for $PATH and $PYTHON_PATH (see below)


HOW TO GET STARTED
------------------
Getting started with the script is fairly easy. First off - read the requirements above. Pay particular attention to the fact that you MUST (seriously) have the latest version of the Xcode Tools installed.

Assuming you've done the above and that you've downloaded the "...And the Kitchen Sink" scripts to your Desktop (and decompressed the files or have cloned the source from github), what you need to do next is simply open up a new Terminal window and type each of the following commands:

$ cd ~/Desktop/kitchensink
$ chmod 755 *.sh
$ ./start.sh download

NOTE: If you run ./start.sh without passing a parameter (download, build) you'll get the built-in help notes that'll explain what to do. Unix is only kinda scary, trust me.

When the download processes have completed, you should have a new 'src' folder containing all the downloaded packages. The next step is to build and install the packages. To do that, type the following at a new shell prompt (the dollar sign in the Terminal window, yo).

$ ./start.sh build

Now - go out for lunch or go see a movie. This part takes a while. The script will configure, compile and install each of the packages in turn. You'll see all kinds of crazy looking stuff fly by in your Terminal window. Just be sure to leave it open and running. It'll tell you when it's done and drop you back at a new prompt.

BOOM! That's it.

SUPPORT
-------
This script has been developed primarily to serve my own needs but I keep it up to date and ensure the included packages are also reasonably updated with the latest security and compatibility fixes. I'll do what I can to help out if you run into a problem, but mostly you're on your own.

Support requests can be submitted via the project's hosting on Github via the Issues tab. Go here: http://github.com/scottboms/andthekitchensink/issues
