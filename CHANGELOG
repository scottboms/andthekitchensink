#########

1.0.5 (2023-01-29)
Updated for macOS Ventura (Intel) including PHP 8.2.1 though it will work with 8.1.x as well.

1.0.4 (2013-01-09)
Starting the process of greatly reducing the overall feature set of this build script to focus it more on a simple extension of a LAMP stack and core tools for web designers.

1.0.3 (2009-07-29)
Major bug fixes and improved conditional checks to ensure things are a bit more
sane. Fewer build errors should slip through now resulting in partly broken

Updated git build to version 1.6.4.1.

1.0.1 (2009-07/29)
Changed download link for Pound. Primary download URL is currently unavailable.

1.0 (2009-07-27)
Initial rewritten release includes 64bit-ready source installs for Snow Leopard.
